# Notes

## Implementation in nodejs
the libarary `grpc` is depricated use `@grpc/grpc-js` instead and use the grpc-js option with code generator for details refer to new library.

## Typescript
The types generated are the alias types on the serverside. Refer to the original types.

## NestJS
The default documentation is tedious to implement and adds the overhead of magic strings.
